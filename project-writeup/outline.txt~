CMSC 471 Final Report Outline
-----------------------------

INTRODUCTION
-what the game is
-where the game came from
-how the game is played

BACKGROUND
-papers we read (with references) 
-why we chose T&K
  -everyone seemed to be doing genetic
  -their algorithm looked interesting, and no indication of it's scalability
   was presented

TEMPOREL & KOVACS ALGORITHM
-note that any time a guess is submitted, if it receives a score of 0 then 
 the colors of that guess are not used in any future guesses.
-submit a guess, consider it the "current favorite guess" (CFG)
-while the guess is not correct:
  -create a new guess based on the score of the previous guess and a list of
   all previous guesses and the CFG by calling GENERATE-VALID-GUESS
  -submit this guess to the code maker
  -if this guess scores at least as good as than the CFG, consider this
   guess the new CFG

 ---
  GENERATE-VALID-GUESS
    -this function uses a hash table to make sure only new guesses are 
     considered. 
    
    -CONSTRUCTING NEW GUESS:
      -for each red, choose an element in the CFG to keep the same
      -for each white, choose a non-red color and swap its position
      -for each remaining peg, probabilistically assign a new color
       based on the CFG (a color in the CFG has a higher probability
       of being chosen) 
THEORETICAL ANALYSIS
-size of search space
-mathematical background of basic-heuristic
-large cost of making sure new guesses are consistent with old guesses
  -maybe try to come up with some numbers?

EVALUATION OF SYSTEM
-baseline: T&K
  -how it performed on various problem sizes
  -how it scaled very poorly 
    -scaled poorly because there are very few guesses that can be consistent
     with old guesses
  -PERFORMANCE
    -4x6, 5x7, 6x8, 7x8, 8x8
    -basic algorithm
    -max's change
    -mark's change
